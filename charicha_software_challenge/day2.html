	<h1> Day 2 </h1>

	<pre> Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.

By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.

E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.

If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.

The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order.
The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!

1 Can you write a solution that will return null2 for both [] and [ x ] though?
(This is an empty array and one with a single number and is not tested for, but you can write your own example test. )

		 if(arr[i] - arr[i-1] != 1)
